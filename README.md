## Inspiration
Our inspiration for BoxHead stemmed from a desire to streamline daily life and assist in critical scenarios, like search and rescue operations.

Search and rescue teams often work in high-pressure situations, and BoxHead's augmented reality technology could be a game-changer. It would provide instant access to essential information, helping teams locate equipment, supplies, or even missing persons more efficiently.

Our vision is to enhance both everyday convenience and the effectiveness of professionals like search and rescue teams by harnessing the power of augmented reality.

## What it does
BoxHead is an innovative augmented reality headset that helps you find your belongings with ease as well has helps locate missing-persons in dangerous situations for search and rescue teams. It uses a combination of AR technology and object recognition to display real-time information about where the object/person you are searching for is located, making the search process quicker and more convenient.

## How we built it
We started our project by using p5.js, which is a fantastic JavaScript library for creative coding and visual arts. We used HTML and CSS to create the user interface and design the appearance of our project. The ml5.js library was a game-changer for us as it provided the AI capabilities we needed. The combination of p5.js and ml5.js allowed us to create a seamless and interactive augmented reality experience with real-time object detection.

## Challenges we ran into
When using Speech Synthesis and Speech Recognition in JavaScript for voice detection we ran into a problem where our project was unable to hear our voices due to how loud it was in the room (because of the many participants). However, we realized that if we utilized a headset with a microphone our software would be able to detect the user's voice a lot clearer (even if there were many other voices heard around the device). Furthermore, we realized that due to the headphones, no other person in the area would be able to hear the Speech Synthesis (during the DEMO) which is why we figured out how to change the output volume settings on our computer so that anyone can hear what our project can do even if they are not wearing the headset.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're immensely proud of creating a solution that genuinely improves people's daily lives by simplifying something as mundane as finding lost items and also improving vision for search and rescue teams. BoxHead's ability to seamlessly integrate AR technology into everyday tasks is a significant accomplishment for our team.

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we learned the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the potential of AR technology to solve real-world problems. We also gained valuable insights into user-centred design and the iterative development process.

## What's next for BoxHead
Our vision for BoxHead extends beyond just finding items. In the future, we plan to expand its capabilities, such as integration with smart home systems, navigation assistance, and even augmented reality gaming. We're excited about the possibilities and are committed to enhancing the BoxHead experience for our users.
